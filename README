# Jade Syntax Highligthing for Netbeans

For use with Jade - (http://jade-lang.com/)[http://jade-lang.com/)

While using Jade in Netbeans for Windows, I got annoyed with the lack of syntax highlighting. 
Following the [syntax highlighting tutorial on Netbeans](http://wiki.netbeans.org/SyntaxColoringANTLR) I whipped up this
very simple first pass at a Netbeans module.

Hopefully it helps someone out! =D

And as a disclaimer, I really have no idea what I'm doing, so please bear with me. But let me know if it doesn't work for some reason.

The .nbm files are located in
